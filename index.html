      <h2>Tech Goals</h2>
      <p>Here are my tech goals for the next two years:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Master a Front-End Framework</li>
        <p>
          I would like to increase my proficiency in a front-end framework like
          React.js by completing courses and certifications on these frameworks
          and also contributing to open-source projects using the framework to
          gain real world experience and improve my skills.
        </p>
        <li>Expand Design Skills</li>
        <p>
          I would also like to enhance my understanding of UI/UX design
          principles to create more user-friendly interfaces by taking courses
          on design principles and experimenting with tools like Figma to create
          wireframes and prototypes for my projects.
        </p>
        <li>Become a Full-Stack Developer</li>
        <p>
          I would like to increase my knowledge in backend technologies so as to
          create complete web applications. I believe this can be achieved by
          learning the server side of web applications like Node.js and
          Express.js and also understanding database management with SQL and
          MongoDB.
        </p>
        <li>Explore AI and Machine Learning</li>
        <p>
          By integrating AI and machine learning to my web applications i would
          be able to create smarter and more intuitive applications for enhanced
          user experiences.
        </p>
      </ol>
      <p>
        While focusing on these goals, I would still follow industry blogs,
        podcasts, and influencers to stay informed about new technologies and
        methodologies and also attending conferences, webinars, and local
        meetups to network with other professionals and learn from experts.so as
        to stay updated on the latest features and improvements
      </p>
